# vtmb-tools

Play Vampire The Masquerade : Bloodlines with NPC models.

## TL;TR

Edit `vtools.conf`, make sure `GAME` is the path to you `Unofficial_Patch`.

Run `newmodels.sh`.

You can edit `newmodels.sh` to setup different NPC models. See `include/pc.sh`
and `include/npc.sh` for an incomplete list.
